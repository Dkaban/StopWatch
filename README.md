# StopWatch
This is my implementation of a StopWatch in java using a GUI system.

### It contains the following files:
- StopWatch.java
- StopWatchPanel.java

### Functionality:
- Press Start to start the timer
- Press Stop to stop the timer
- Press Reset to reset the timer
- If you press Start after pressing stop, the timer will resume
- Key commands also work.  A starts the timer, D stops it, R resets it.
